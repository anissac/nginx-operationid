NGINX plugin that sets a different operationid on each and every request.

It is meant to trace one or several upstream queries triggered by a single incoming 
request.

The $operationid can be used to log it.

It can also be propagated as a header to an upstram server using proxy_set_header. 
The upstream server will look for the header and use the same operationid.

operationid on; # set up the module
operationid_header X-Ngx-OperationId; # set the header to look for in the 
                                      # incoming query.
